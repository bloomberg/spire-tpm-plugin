# SPIRE TPM Plugin

This repository contains agent and server plugins for [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) to allow TPM 2-based node attestation.

## Demo

Here's a quick demo that shows how this plugin looks when run:

## Quick Start

Before starting, create a running SPIRE deployment and add the following configuration to the agent and server:

### Agent Configuration

```hcl
NodeAttestor "tpm" {
	plugin_cmd = "/path/to/plugin_cmd"
	plugin_checksum = "sha256 of the plugin binary"
	plugin_data {
	}
}
```

### Server Configuration

```hcl
NodeAttestor "tpm" {
	plugin_cmd = "/path/to/plugin_cmd"
	plugin_checksum = "sha256 of the plugin binary"
	plugin_data {
		ca_path = "/opt/spire/.data/certs"
		hash_path = "/opt/spire/.data/hashes"
	}
}
```

| key | type | required | description | default |
|:----|:-----|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| ca_path | string |   | the path to the CA directory | /opt/spire/.data/certs |
| hash_path | string |   | the path to the Hash directory | /opt/spire/.data/hashes |

### Directory Configuration

For this plugin to work, either `ca_path`, `hash_path`, or both must be configured.

#### Certificate Directory

Contains the manufacturer CA cert that signed the TPM's EK certificate in PEM or DER format. Drop all manufacturer CA certs in the directory `ca_path`.

*Note: not all TPM's have an EK certificate, if yours does not then use `hash_path`*

#### Hash Directory

Contains empty files named after the EK public key hash.  Use the `get_tpm_pubhash` command to print out the TPM's EK public key hash.  Example:

```bash
agent  $ ./get_tpm_pubhash
1b5bbe2e96054f7bc34ebe7ba9a4a9eac5611c6879285ceff6094fa556af485c 

server $ mkdir -p /opt/spire/.data/hashes
server $ touch /opt/spire/.data/hashes/1b5bbe2e96054f7bc34ebe7ba9a4a9eac5611c6879285ceff6094fa556af485c
```

## How it Works

The plugin uses TPM credential activation as the method of attestation. The plugin operates as follows:

1. Agent generates AK (attestation key) using TPM
1. Agent sends the AK attestation parameters and EK certificate or public key to the server
1. Server inspects EK certificate or public key
    1. If `hash_path` exists, and the public key hash matches filename in `hash_path`, validation passes
    1. If `ca_path` exists, and the EK certificate was signed by any chain in `ca_path`, validation passes
1. If validation passed, the server generates a credential activation challenge using
    1. The EK public key
    1. The AK attestation parameters
1. Server sends challenge to agent
1. Agent decrypts the challenge's secret 
1. Agent sends back decrypted secret
1. Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to build the challenge
1. Server creates a SPIFFE ID in the form of `spiffe://<trust_domain>/agent/tpm/<sha256sum_of_tpm_pubkey>`
1. All done!

## Building

To build this plugin on Linux, run `make build`. Because of the dependency on [go-attestation](https://github.com/google/go-attestation), you must have `libtspi-dev` installed.
